                    <p>I wanted to make something cool and to practice my skills, so i've made screen in roblox where the python script sends my screen hex pixel to pixel and then sends it to roblox and repeat. It was slow at the start but i improved it and it was running like in 4fps. Someone bought it from me and then i just stoped making the screen.</p>

                    <p>I made a minecraft copy, to script the game there were obstacles like the blocks placing in wrong grid, terrain generation glitching out, serversiding it, chunk generation, and many more. The game was never finished</p>
